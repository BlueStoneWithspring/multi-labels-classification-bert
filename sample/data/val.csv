20,"Places and People      Where you are dropped, as the saying is, is who you are, at least in a certain limited sense. If you are dropped in Bitlis but are soon taken to New York, Bitlis is less who you are than New York is. But the place you knew first is at least a large part of who you are. Places make people. They very definitely do, almost physically. Places procreate   ①  . They are part of the human procreation process.   There are many men and women who wouldn’t think of engaging in the procreative act in certain places of the world, and there are other places in which nothing seems more right and pleasant.  There are places that are all business, and places that are all fun and frolic   ②  , and still other places that are all light and song and the senses and love.  After the World, after being anywhere at all, my place was Fresno, and as far as I am concerned it was the very best possible place for me to be―and for this reason: that’s where I was dropped. The minute we met, that was it. We belonged to each other. Forever, It was a fact.  I was born there. I wasn’t born in Bitils, Marseilles, London, New York, or anywhere else. I was born in Fresno. It was my place. I loved it. I hated it. But had I been born in Paris, I would have loved Paris, and I would have hated it. Fresno had great early appeal for me.   It had a fine smell of dust, of the desert, of rocks baking in the sun, of sand with cactus    ③   growing out of it, of water flowing in rivers and ditches, of leaf and blossom and fruit.  It also had all of the smells of rot, decay, and ferment   ④  : the great heaps of grape pulp and skin at the wineries   ⑤  sent a smell all through the town if there was a little wind stirring.   There were also the magnificent smells in the house in which one did one’s early time: the very walls themselves, the people who lived in the house, and the things they cooked or baked: Armenian bread, for instance, in the three popular forms prepared by the Saroyan family: the round, wafer    ⑥   -thin flat bread, the oval loaf bread only an inch or two thick, and the diamond-shaped little loaves of butter bread.  There was also always the smell of various green things, or growing things―parsley   ⑦  , mint, basil, onions, bell peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, and so on and so forth.  All of these things were a part of the place, and very quickly a part of me. Fresno was my place, and my family was my place.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
193,"The Pleasures of Ignorance       It is impossible to take a walk in the country with an average townsman   -   especially, perhaps, in April or May-without being amazed at the   vast continent   of his ignorance.  It is impossible to take a walk in the country oneself without being amazed at the vast continent of one's own ignorance. Thousands of men and women live and die without knowing the difference between a  beech and an elm  , between the song of a  thrush  and the song of a blackbird. Probably in a modern city the man who can distinguish between a thrush's and a blackbird's song is the exception. It is not that we have not seen the birds. It is simply that we have not noticed them.   We have been surrounded by birds all our lives, yet so    feeble   ①   is our observation that many of us could not tell whether or not the   chaffinch   sings, or the colour of the cuckoo.  This ignorance, however, is not altogether miserable. Out of it we get the constant pleasure of discovery.   Every fact of nature comes to us each spring, if only we are sufficiently ignorant, with the   dew   still on it.  If we have lived half a lifetime without having ever even seen a cuckoo, and know it only as a wandering voice, we are all the more delighted at the  spectacle   ②  of its runaway flight as it hurries from wood to wood conscious of its crimes, and at the way in which it  halts   ③  hawk  -like in the wind, its long tail  quivering   ④  , before it dares  descend   ⑤  on a hill-side of fir-trees where avenging presences may  lurk   ⑥  .  It would be absurd to pretend that the naturalist does not also find pleasure in observing the life of the birds, but his is a steady pleasure, almost a  sober   ⑦  and  plodding   ⑧  occupation, compared to the morning enthusiasm of the man who sees a cuckoo for the first time. And, as to that, the happiness even of the naturalist depends in some measure upon his ignorance, which still leaves him new worlds of this kind to conquer.  He may have reached the very Z of knowledge in the books, but he still feels half ignorant until he has confirmed each bright particular with his eyes. Assuredly the men of science have no reason as yet to weep over their lost ignorance. There will always be a fortune of ignorance waiting for them under every fact they turn up.   But your and my ignorance is not    confined   ⑨   to cuckoos. It    dabbles   ⑩   in all created things, from the sun and moon down to the names of the flowers, including nearly everything you and I have taken for granted.  One of the greatest joys known to man is to take such a flight into ignorance in search of knowledge. The great pleasure of ignorance is, after all, the pleasure of asking questions. The man who has lost this pleasure or exchanged it for the pleasure of  dogma   ?  , which is the pleasure of answering, is already beginning to stiffen.   Do not forget that Socrates   was famed for wisdom not because he was    omniscient   ?   but because he realised at the age of seventy that he still knew nothing.

Give love, for in giving it you will find the power in life along with the joy, happiness, patience and understanding.Believe in the goodness of others and remember that anger and depression   ①  can be countered   ②  by love and hope.   Even when you feel as though there isn't a lot you can do to change unhappiness or problems, you can always do a little-and a little at a time eventually makes a big difference.

172,"E   mbrace your ignorance      During my last year at university,  I panicked.I realised that I was about to be sent into the world almost entirely ignorant.(Commenters,please fill in own joke here.)I had half-absorbed a few tiny bits of western history,  and I’d read and then mostly forgotten some German novels and poems.  I knew nothing about science.  I hadn’t the   faintest   ①  idea how the world worked.  I wasn’t even entirely sure what interest rates were.  Shortly before graduating,  I   confessed   ②  my anxieties to a high-powered thirtysomething at a dinner in London.“Don’t worry,”  he said.“I knew nothing when I graduated either,  so I’ve just kept learning.  Now my employer is paying for me to study Arabic.”  That same evening,  I resolved to pursue a project of life-long learning.  Twenty-five years on,  I’m still ignorant,  but still at it.   Because I graduated in Britain,   I missed out on the traditional American commencement ceremony at which a middle-aged bore intones,   “You can be whatever you want to be.”  Instead,  a middle-aged bore   droned on   ③  at us in Latin for an hour.  But if any American university is still looking for a middle-aged-bore speaker this commencement season,  here’s what I’d tell the graduates:  “After graduating,  I decided to find out what interest rates were,  so I began reading a newspaper I’d never opened before:  the Financial Times.  I kept going,  hoping I’d eventually learn the thing I most wanted to know:  why some people and countries were rich and others poor.  In 1994,  trying to accelerate the learning process,  I joined the FT.  I thought that after a few years I’d know enough to go on and do something more useful than journalism,  but it never happened.  “Like me back then,  you are graduating almost entirely ignorant.  This isn’t your fault.  Your most   fecund   ④  educational years were aged nought to three,  when your brain was fairly   porous   ⑤  ,  but the opportunity was probably wasted.  You then spent each school day surrounded by up to 30 other people,  each with their own problems and ability levels.  Since high school,  you’ve been additionally   handicapped   ⑥  by hormones,  smartphones and early-morning starts.  “In short,  you’re going to have to keep learning all your life.  Here are a few tips:  Just shut up and listen.  Whenever you think,  ‘I know about that’,  you don’t.  When you hear yourself saying something you’ve said before,  don’t bother.  When someone worthwhile tells you something about North Korea,  don’t sit there waiting till you can interrupt with your one   factoid    ⑦  about North Korea.  Pre-rehearsed   anecdotes    ⑧  will keep you dumb.   Also avoid all house-price talk,   route talk,   diet talk,   name-dropping and current-affairs clichés.  Over a lifetime,  this can save you years.  Listen hardest to people younger than you.  They are ignorant and generally have lowly jobs,  but their  fragments  of knowledge will be more cutting-edge than yours.   If you’re ever   tempted   to kid yourself that your knowledge will hold good over time,   listen to aged relatives recite the race theories they picked up in the 1940s.  When you meet someone who likes   pontificating   ⑨  ,you might pick up his tiny bit of expertise,  if he has any.  You’ll probably never have a productive conversation with him,  and he won’t have learnt much from other people,  so best to avoid.  When you discover you were wrong about something,  don’t fight it.  Treasure the moment:  you’ve learnt something.  Don’t let conflicts   derail   ⑩  your working life.  Frequent changes of career will stop you from increasing your  competence  in one particular field.  If you have to work with somebody  irritating,  deal with it.  If you find lots of people irritating,then you’re the problem.  Even if you become an expert,you’ll still be pretty ignorant.What experts know about any topic is always infinitely less than what they don’t know.  Obviously,  you can’t be whatever you want to be.

For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago.  I  n your hands, my fellow   ⑤  citizens, more than in mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course. Since this country was founded, each generation   ⑥  of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty   ⑦  . The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe.  Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are; but a call to bear the burden   ⑧  of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, “rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation”, a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself.  Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance   ⑨  , North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful   ⑩  life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?   In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum    ?   danger.  I do not shrink from this responsibility. I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it. And the glow from that fire can truly light the world.  And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.   My fellow citizens of the world, ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man.  Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice   ?  which we ask of you.  With a good conscience   ?  our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing   ?  and His help, but knowing that here on earth, God’s work must truly be our own.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
32,"Feed Your Mind      Since the pre-historic times, man has had an urge to satisfy his needs. Be it hunger, shelter or search for a mate, he has always manipulated   ①  the circumstances to the best of his advantages.   Probably this might be the reason why we human are the most developed of all living species on the earth, and probably also in the universe.  As we climbed the steps of evolution with giant leaps, we somehow left behind common sense and logical thinking ― we forgot that we have stopped thinking ahead of times.  If you are hungry, what do you do? Grab a piece of your favorite meal and stay quiet after that? Just like your stomach, even your mind is hungry. But it never lets you know, because you keep it busy thinking about your dream lover, favorite star and many such absurd things. So it silently began to heed to your needs and never let itself grow. When mind looses its freedom to grow, creativity gets a full stop. This might be the reason why we all sometimes think ""What happens next?"", ""Why can't I think?"", ""Why am I always given the difficult problems?"" Well this is the aftermath of our own karma   ②  of using our brain for thinking of not-so-worthy things.  Hunger of the mind can be actually satiated   ③  through extensive reading. Now why reading and not watching TV? Because reading has been the most educative tool used by us right from the childhood. Just like that to develop other aspects of our life, we have to take help of reading. You have innumerable number of books in this world which will answer all your “How to?” questions. Once you read a book, you just don't run your eyes through the lines, but even your mind decodes   ④  it and explains it to you.   The interesting part of the book is stored in your mind as a seed. Now this seed is unknowingly used by you in your future to develop new ideas. The same seed if used many times, can help you link and relate a lot of things, of which you would have never thought of in your wildest dreams!  This is nothing but creativity. More the number of books you read, your mind will open up like never before. Also this improves your oratory   ⑤  skills to a large extent and also makes a significant contribution to your vocabulary. Within no time you start speaking English or any language fluently with your friends or other people and you never seem to run out of the right words at the right time.   Actually, I had a problem in speaking English fluently, but as I read, I could improve significantly. I am still on the path of improvement to quench    ⑥   my thirst for satisfaction.

200,"The Road to Success      It is well that young men should begin at the beginning and occupy the most subordinate   ①  positions. Many of the leading businessmen of Pittsburgh had a serious responsibility thrust   ②  upon them at the very threshold   ③  of their career. They were introduced to the broom  ，  and spent the first hours of their business lives sweeping out the office. I notice we have janitors and janitresses now in offices  ，  and our young men unfortunately miss that salutary   ④  branch of business education. But if by chance the professional sweeper is absent any morning  ，  the boy who has the genius of the future partner in him will not hesitate to try his hand at the broom. It does not hurt the newest comer to sweep out the office if necessary. I was one of those sweepers myself.  Assuming that you have all obtained employment and are fairly started, my advice to you is “aim high”. I would not give a fig   ⑤  for the young man who does not already see himself the partner or the head of an important firm. Do not rest content for a moment in your thoughts as head clerk, or foreman, or general manager in any concern, no matter how extensive. Say to yourself, “My place is at the top.” Be king in your dreams.  And here is the prime condition of success, the great secret: concentrate your energy, thought, and capital exclusively   ⑥  upon the business in which you are engaged. Having begun in one line, resolve to fight it out on that line, to lead in it, adopt every improvement, have the best machinery, and know the most about it.  The concerns which fail are those which have scattered   ⑦  their capital, which means that they have scattered their brains also. They have investments in this, or that, or the other, here there, and everywhere. ""Don't put all your eggs in one basket. ""is all wrong. I tell you to"" put all your eggs in one basket, and then watch that basket."" Look round you and take notice, men who do that not often fail. It is easy to watch and carry the one basket. It is trying to carry too many baskets that breaks most eggs in this country. He who carries three baskets must put one on his head, which is apt to tumble   ⑧  and trip him up. One fault of the American businessman is lack of concentration.  To summarize what I have said: aim for the highest; never enter a bar room; do not touch liquor, or if at all only at meals; never speculate   ⑨  ; never indorse beyond your surplus cash fund; make the firm's interest yours; break orders always to save owners; concentrate; put all your eggs in one basket, and watch that basket; expenditure   ⑩  always within revenue; lastly, be not impatient, for as Emerson says,"" no one can cheat you out of ultimate success but yourselves.""",1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

297,"The Delights of Reading      All the wisdom of the ages,all the stories that have delighted   ①  mankind for centuries,are easily and cheaply available to all of us within the covers of books but we must know how to avail   ②  ourselves of this treasure and how to get the most from it.The most unfortunate people in the world are those who have never discovered how satisfying it is to read good books.  I am most interested in people,in them and finding out about them.Some of the most remarkable   ③  people I’ve met existed only in a writer’s imagination,then on the pages of his book,and then,again,in my imagination.I’ve found in books new friends,new societies,new words.  If I am interested in people,others are interested not so much in who as in how.Who in the books includes everybody from science fiction superman two hundred centuries in the future all the way back to the first figures in history.How covers everything from the ingenious   ④  explanations of Sherlock Holmes to the discoveries of science and ways of teaching manner to children.   Reading is pleasure of the mind,which means that it is a little like a sport:your eagerness    ⑤   and knowledge and quickness make you a good reader.  Reading is fun,not because the writer is telling you something,but because it makes your mind work.Your own imagination works along with the author’s or even goes beyond his.Your experience,compared with his,brings you to the same or different conclusions   ⑥  ,and your ideas develop as you understand his.  Every book stands by itself,like a one-family house,but books in a library are like houses in a city.Although they are separate,together they all add up to something,they are connected with each other and with other cities.The same ideas,or related ones,turn up in different places;the human problems that repeat themselves in life repeat themselves in literature,but with different solutions   ⑦  according to different writings at different times.Books influence   ⑧  each other;they link the past,the present and the future and have their own generations,like families.Wherever you start reading you connect yourself with one of the families of ideas,and in the long run,you not only find out about the world and the people in it;you find out about yourself,too.  Reading can only be fun if you expect it to be.If you concentrate on   ⑨  books somebody tells you you“ought”to read,you probably won’t have fun.   But if you put down a book you don’t like and try another till you find one that means something to you,and then relax with it,you will almost certainly have a good time and if you become,as a result of reading,better,wiser,kinder,or more gentle,you won’t have suffered during the process.",1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

It is no longer a difference in degrees of maturity, for all the trees have darkened to their final tone, and stand in their differences of character and not of mere date.  Almost all the green is grave, not sad and not dull. It has a darkened and a daily colour, in majestic but not obvious harmony with dark grey skies, and might look, to inconstant eyes, as prosaic after spring as eleven o'clock looks after the dawn.  Gravity is the word---not solemnity as towards evening, nor menace   ①  as at night. The daylight trees of July are signs of common beauty, common freshness, and a mystery familiar and abiding as night and day. In childhood we all have a more exalted sense of dawn and summer sunrise than we ever fully retain or quite recover; and also a far-higher sensibility for April and April evenings---a heartache for them, which in riper years is gradually and irretrievably   ②  consoled.   But, on the other hand, childhood has so quickly learned to find daily things tedious, and familiar things importunate    ③   , that it has no great delight in the mere middle of the day, and feels weariness of the summer that has ceased to change visibly.  The poetry of mere day and of late summer becomes perceptible to mature eyes that have long ceased to be sated, have taken leave of weariness, and cannot now find anything in nature too familiar; eyes which have, indeed, lost sight of the further awe of midsummer daybreak, and no longer see so much of the past in April twilight   ④  as they saw when they had no past; but which look freshly at the dailiness of green summer, of early afternoon, of every sky of any form that comes to pass, and of the darkened elms   ⑤  .",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The relief was audible   ⑦  as a number of students jumped up to thank the professor and departed from class.The professor looked at the handful of students who remained,and offered again,""Any other takers?This is your last opportunity.""One more student decided to go.  Seven students remained.The professor closed the door and took attendance.Then he handed out the final exam.There were two sentences typed on the paper:  ""Congratulations,you have just received an A in this class.Keep believing in yourself.""  I never had a professor who gave a test like that.It may seem like the easy way out of grading a bunch of exams,but it's a test that any teacher in any discipline   ⑧  could and should give.Students who don't have confidence in what they've learned are B students at best.  The same is true for students of real life.The A students are those who believe in what they're doing because they've learned from both successes and failures.They've absorbed life's lessons,whether from formal education or the school of hard knocks,and become better people.  Those are the people who you look for when you're hiring or promoting,and the ones you keep if you're downsizing   ⑨  .Your organisation needs their brand of thinking.  Psychologists say that by the age of two,50 percent of what we ever believe about ourselves has been formed;by age six,60 percent,and at eight years,80 percent.Wouldn't you love to have the energy and optimism of a little kid?There is nothing you couldn't do or learn or be.  Believing in yourself comes from knowing what you are really capable of doing.When it's your turn to step up to the plate,realise that you won't hit a homerun every time.Baseball superstar Mickey Mantle struck out more than 1,700 times,but it didn't stop him from excelling   ⑩  at baseball.He believed in himself,and he knew his fans believed in him.   Surround yourself with positive people-they know the importance of confidence and will help you keep focused on what you can do instead of what you can't.Who you surround yourself with is who you become.

Be very careful not to confuse confidence with a big ego.If you want people to believe in you,you also have to believe in them.  Understand well that those around you also have much to contribute,and they deserve your support.Without faith in yourself and others,success is impossible.

386,"Translation      In a few years  ,  you might be able to speak Chinese  ,  Korean  ,  Japanese  ,  French  ,  and English  ―  and all at the same time.  This sounds incredible   ①  ,  but Alex Waibel  ,  a computer science professor at US's Carnegie Mellon University   （   CMU   ）   and Germany's University of Karlsruhe  ,  announced last week that it may soon be reality.  He and his team have invented software and hardware that could make it far easier for people who speak different languages to understand each other.  One application  ,  called Lecture Translation  ,  can easily translate a speech from one language into another.  Current translation technologies typically limit speakers to certain topics or a limited vocabulary.Users also have to be trained how to use the programme.  Another prototype  (   雏形机  )  can send translations of a speech to different listeners depending on what language they speak.“It is like having a simultaneous   ②  translator right next to you but without disturbing the person next to you.”Waibel said.  Prefer to read   ？   So-called Translation Glasses transcribe   （转录）   the translations on a tiny liquid-crystal   （液晶）   display   （   LCD   ）   screen.  Then there's the Muscle Translator.   Electrodes    ③   capture the electrical signals from facial muscle movements made naturally when a person is mouthing words.  The signals are then translated into speech.  The electrodes could be replaced with wireless chips implanted in a person's face  ,  according to researchers.  During a demonstration   ④  held last Thursday in CMU's Pit  t  sburgh campus  ,  a Chinese student named  Stan Jou  had 11 tiny electrodes attached to the muscles of his cheeks  ,  neck and throat.  Then he mouthed  ―  without speaking aloud  ―  a few words in Mandarin   （普通话）   to the audience.  A few seconds later  ,  the phrase was displayed on a computer screen and spoken out by the computer in English and Spanish:“Let me introduce our new prototype.""  This particular gadget   （器械）  ,  when fully developed   ，   might allow anyone to speak in any number of languages or  ,  as Waibel put it   ，   ""to switch your mouth to a foreign language"".   “The idea behind the university's prototypes    ⑤   is to create‘good enough'   bridges for cross-cultural exchanges that are becoming more common in the world    ，    ""Waibel said.   With spontaneous    （自发的）    translators   ,   foreign drivers in Germany could listen to traffic wa   rn   ings on the radio    ，    tourists in China could read all the signs and talk with local people   ,   and leaders of different countries could have secret talks without any interpreters there.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0

The idea that the homeless are different to the likes of us is really a failure of imagination.  It  ’  s also a very dangerous way of thinking.  As the latest natio  nal statistics relea  sed in June show,the number of homeless in England has risen by almost 1/5 compared with the same period last year.

We need to stop placing so much value on what a person earns,and putting more on what they do.  Don  ’  t get me wrong-bein  g ambitious i  s not a fault,  and achievements should always be celebrated.  But when a person uses their success to judge you negatively,  it becomes a problem.

These colourful and sweet jewels from British Columbia’s fields are little powerhouses of nutritional protection.  Of the common berries, strawberries are highest in vitamin C, although, because of their seeds, raspberries   ①  contain a little more protein (  蛋白质  ), iron and zinc (not that fruits have much protein). Blueberries are particularly high in antioxidants (  抗氧化物质  ). The yellow and orange stone fruits such as peaches are high in the carotenoids we turn into vitamin A and which are antioxidants. As for cherries (  樱桃  ), they are so delicious who cares? However, they are rich in vitamin C.  When combined with berries of slices   ②  of other fruits, frozen bananas make an excellent base for thick, cooling fruit shakes and low fat “ice cream”. For this purpose, select ripe bananas for freezing as they are much sweeter. Remove the skin and place them in plastic bags or containers and freeze.

Frank Hurley's pictures would be outstanding  ―  undoubtedly  first-rate photo-journalism   ①  ―  if they had been made last week.   In fact   ,   they were shot from 1914 through 1916   ,   most of them after a disastrous shipwreck    （海难）   ,   by a cameraman who had no reasonable expectation of survival    ②   .  Many of the images were stored in an ice chest  ,  under freezing water  ,  in the damaged wooden ship.  The ship was the Endurance  ,  a small  ,  tight  ,  Norwegian-built three-master that was intended to take Sir Ernest Shackleton and a small crew   ③  of seamen and scientists  ,  27 men in all  ,  to the southernmost shore of Antarctica's Weddell Sea.From that point Shackleton wanted to force a passage by dog sled   （雪橇）   across the continent.The journey was intended to achieve   ④  more than what Captain Robert Falcon Scott had done.  Captain Scott had reached the South Pole early in 1912 but had died with his four companions on the march back.

There is nothing like seeing a loved one’s smiling face looking down on you from a picture frame on your wall. It is both comforting and reassuring  ,  almost like they are watching over you while you work at your desk.  As I work at my own desk I can see my Mom’s picture smiling down on me.

A lot of people say that you have to have a hard heart to get through life. Others say a soft heart is better. I myself think that a strong heart is best. We need a heart that loves through the pain. We need a heart that keeps loving even when we lose the people we love the most.   We need a heart that knows that “Anyone who lives in love lives in God   ,   and God lives in him.”  May your heart be strong then.

And simultaneously,we ensure that we are never far from something that can take us powerfully away from ourselves,and so miss out on the troubling wonders that streak across the mental horizon at every instant.   Most of what is in our minds remains unfelt and unseen,troubling us only in the small hours.  Insomnia is the revenge for all that we tried so hard not to notice in the daylight.  In this context,emotional intelligence emerges as a species of courage,directed at vanquishing   ?  not an external enemy but a fear of being weird or of going mad.  A certain sort of intelligent person is,above all else,a superior and more committed reporter of their inner states.  Or,as Emerson once put it,  ‘  In the minds of geniuses,we findConce moreCour own neglected thoughts.’   It is almost certain that people who have devoted themselves to self-honesty and self-observation have an above average chance of meeting with incomprehension,irritation,censorship or boredom when they attempt to share the data from their own minds frankly in company.  Their thoughts(it might be on politics or architecture,family life or sexuality)will sound more threatening,more intense,oblique or tender than is allowed.  That feels lonely,if one is in the mood to frame things like this.  There are simply fewer people at large committed to self-honesty and self-observationCand therefore up for exchanging notes on what it’s truly like to be alive.  Yet there is one resource that is exceptionally well suited to addressing the feelings of disconnection liable to be felt by the emotionally intelligent:art.  Works of art are humanity’s secret diary:records of all that could not be said in regular social contexts,but which have found a home in the more intimate,honest communication that can take place between an art-work and its audience.  The libraries,cinemas and galleries of the world are repositories   ?  for all the sensations that didn’t easily make it into standard interactions and that contain what we need to state,and crave to hear as audiences,in our lonely states.  Therefore,while emotionally intelligent people may have an uncommonly hard time not being lonely with a person,they have an unusually easy time finding company with people who are not in the room,the fancy term for what we call art.  We have perhaps over-privileged certain standard notions of friendship.  We may just have to accept that our best friends could have died 250 years agoCand be chatting to us via dabs of paint or within rhyming pentameters   ?  .  That said,the goal shouldn’t be a society where art is ever more prevalent and more available when loneliness strikes.  It is perhaps a society where art is ever less necessaryCbecause we have grown better at knowing how to share more of who we are in the ordinary moments of our lives;where we have found a more direct and reliable path out from our loneliness.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I pulled it into a garage,and the young mechanic had it fixed in just a few minutes.He knew what was wrong by simply listening to the engine.I was amazed.The sad truth is,great talent is not enough.  I am constantly shocked at how little talented   ①  people earn.  I heard the other day that less than percent of Americans earn more than$100,000 a year.   A business consultant who specializes    ②   in the medical trade was telling me how many doctors,dentists and chiropractors struggle financially    ③   .  All this time,I thought that when they graduated,the dollars would pour in.It was this business consultant   ④  who gave me the phrase.  They are one skill away from great wealth.   What this phrase means is that most people need only to learn and master one more skill and their income would jump exponentially.  I have mentioned before that financial intelligence   ⑤  is a synergy  of  accounting   ⑥  ,investing,marketing and law.  Combine   ⑦  those four technical skills and making money with money is easier.When it comes to money,the only skill most people know is to work hard.  When I graduated from the U.S.Merchant Marine Academy in 1969,my educated dad was happy.Standard Oil of California had hired me for its oil-tanker fleet.  I had a great career ahead of me,yet I resigned   ⑧  after six months with the company and joined the Marine Corps to learn how to fly.  My educated dad was devastated.Rich dad congratulated me.  Job security   ⑨  meant everything to my educated dad.  Learning meant everything to my rich dad  .  Educated dad thought  I  went to school to learn to be a ship's officer.  Rich dad knew that  I  went to school to study international trade.

There is an old cliche that goes,""Job is an acronym for'Just Over Broke.""'And unfortunately,  I  would say that the saying applies to millions of people.  Because school does not think financial intelligence is intelligence,most workers""live within their means.""

The answer is obvious:McDonald's is excellent at business systems.The reason so many talented   ?  people are poor is because they focus on building a better hamburger and know little or nothing about business systems.

Why,you might ask?Mr Left is a talker,while Mr Right is a doer.That actually makes sense in China.As you might know,Chinese men do not often say,""I love you.""They believe actions speak louder than words.Therefore,women have to rely on their actions to see how much he cares about her.

176,"Love is everywhere      I have always believed that reading books can expand the mind, touch the heart, and enrich the soul. They can also cause your imagination to do some funny things at times. I can remember several years ago reading a book where the hero went through several tragedies   ①  and at one point in the midst of his pain and torment   ②  cried out: “Where is Love?”. At that moment in my imagination I leapt into the story, grabbed him by the arm and told him: “It’s everywhere! It’s everywhere!” Love is everywhere. You just have to open your heart to see it.  For me it is there every time I watch the dawn break upon a new day. It is there every time a brisk winter breeze blows across my face. It is there in the first flower of Spring. It is there in the green grass of Summer. It is there in the last leaf of Fall. It is there every time my handicapped   ③  sons give me a hug. It is there every time my daughter laughs at one of my dumb jokes. It is there in the adoring   ④  eyes of my old beagle   ⑤  and my new puppy. It is there in the purring cat that naps on my chest. It is there in the smile of the clerk behind the counter. It is there in the old man who opens a door for me. It is there when I read a letter from a friend. It is there every time I pray.   It is there in everything I write and every act of kindness I do.  The Bible tells us that “God is Love.” And since God is without beginning or end then so is love. It fills all of His creation. It fills us as well every time we open our hearts and souls to it. Don’t shut out love then. Don’t live your life in pain. Open your heart instead. Share your love instead.   You will find that the more love you give away, the more love you will have. You will find that the more love you share, the more God’s love will surround you.

141,"Pennies from Granny      We had moved from Cairo to Mt. Vernon, Illinois, away from my grandmother when I was eight years old. I missed her terribly. I was told I was her favorite grandchild; she was my favorite “Granny.” She was my Father’s mother.  Two years later my mother and father separated and they were soon divorced. I felt as if my world was falling apart.   My heart ached for that part of me that was slipping away.  Mother must have sensed my longing, for she would take my little brother and me back to visit my Granny on occasions, even after the divorce.  I was always aware Granny loved us.   It was something you could feel with your heart, even when your world was turned upside down.  She didn’t live in a fancy house or have expensive things, but I never noticed; I just knew she loved me and I loved her back.  We had lived, for a time, next door to her and grandpa in a duplex   ①  while my father was away during World War II.  Granny had never had very much in the way of money or material things.   But it was the little things she gave me that had always mattered.   Things like letting me dip my fingers in the sugar bowl, which was always sitting on her table or the coffee she let me sip    ②   from her cup.  She allowed me to sit on top of her kitchen table as I partook   ③  of those privileges.  Granny took the time to explain the function of her weather vane   ④  , hanging on the wall, which predicted the upcoming weather.   How that little wooden boy and girl knew what door to come out of, when it was going to rain, amazed me.  But Granny understood.   She also had a vinegar cruet    ⑤   that sat high on a shelf that was beautiful, in my eyes;  I asked if I could have it someday. It was given to me in a box after her funeral. She remembered; love is like that.  I used to spend a lot of time with Granny when we lived in Cairo, next door to her and grandpa, in the duplex. But times and things had changed. Grandpa had died; we lived a hundred miles away, and dad, her youngest son, my daddy, no longer lived with us. I didn’t get to see dad much, and I don’t know if Granny got to see him very often either. But, he was her son, and I knew she loved him. Love is like that; it can see past the pain.  Though she didn’t have much, neither did we, but she did something for my brother, Tommie and me. I will always remember; she saved her pennies in a glass jar. I am sure Granny could have used those pennies herself but she saved them to give us when we came to visit. Because I was the oldest I was in charge of dividing the pennies equally between my brother and me.  “One for you, one for me,” I would repeat until the jar was empty.  I don’t remember how much we collected on our visits, nor was the amount important. It was the idea that she remembered us, and cared about us, when we were away from her.  Those memories, of when I was a child, still give me warm fuzzy feelings on days that I need them. A Granny’s love stays with a grandchild, down through the years, even when that child becomes a grandma herself. I often wonder, after all those years, when I am lucky enough to find a penny lying on the ground somewhere, if it could possibly be Granny tossing   ⑥  me pennies from heaven.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

89,"The Pleasure of Reading      All the wisdom of the ages, all the stories that have delighted mankind for centuries, are easily and cheaply available to all of us within the covers of books―but we must know how to avail ourselves of this treasure and how to get the most of it.  I am most interested in people, in meeting them and finding out about them. Some of the most remarkable people I’ve met existed only in a writer’s imagination, then on the pages of his book, and then, again, in my imagination. I’ve found in books new friends, new societies, new worlds.  If I am interested in people, others are interested not so much in who as in how. Who in the books includes everybody from science-fiction superman two hundred centuries in the future all the way back to the first figures in history how covers everything from the ingenious  ①  explanations of Sherlock Holmes  to the discoveries of science and ways of teaching manners to children.   Reading is a pleasure of the mind, which means that it is a little like a sport: your eagerness and knowledge and quickness make you a good reader.  Reading is fun, not because the writer is telling you something, but because it makes your mind work. Your own imagination works along with the author’s or even goes beyond his. Your experience, compared with his, brings you to the same or different conclusions, and your ideas develop as you understand his.   Every book stands by itself, like a one-family   h   ouse, but books in a library are like houses in a city.  Although they are separate, together they all add up to something; they are connected with each other and with other cities. The same ideas, or related ones, turn up in different places; the human problems that repeat themselves in life repeat themselves in literature, but with different solutions according to different writings at different times.  Reading can only be fun if you expect it to be. If you concentrate on books somebody tells you “ought” to read, you probably won’t have fun .   But if you put down a book you don’t like and try another till you find one that means something to you, and then relax with it, you will almost certainly have a good time―and if you become as a result of reading, better, wiser, or more gentle, you won’t have suffered during the process.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
306,"E  xpedition      Larry was on another of his underwater expeditions (   探险   ) but this time, it was different. He decided to take his daughter along with him. She was only ten years old.   This would be her first trip with her father on what he had always been famous for.  Larry first began diving when he was his daughter’s age. Similarly, his father had taken him along on one of his expeditions. Since then, he had never looked back. Larry started out by renting diving suits from the small diving shop just along the shore. He had hated them. They were either too big or too small. Then, there was the instructor   ①  . He gave him a short lesson before allowing him into the water with his father. He had made an exception. Larry would never have been able to go down without at least five hours of theory and another similar number of hours on practical lessons with a guide. Children his age were not even allowed to dive.  After the first expedition, Larry’s later diving adventures   ②  only got better and better. There was never a dull moment. In his black and blue suit and with an oxygen tank   ③  fastened   ④  on his back, Larry dived from boats into the middle of the ocean. Dangerous areas did not prevent him from continuing his search. Sometimes, he was limited to a cage underwater but that did not bother him. At least, he was still able to take photographs of the underwater creatures   ⑤  .

17,"Cultivating a Hobby      A gifted American psychologist has said ,“Worry is a spasm   ①  of the emotion; the mind catches hold of something and will not let it go.” It is useless to argue with the mind in this condition. The stronger the will, the more futile the task. One can only gently insinuate   ②  something else into its  convulsive   ③  grasp.   And if this something else is rightly chosen, if it is really attended by the   illumination   of another field of interest, gradually, and often swiftly, the old undue grip relaxes and the process of   recuperation   ④   and repair ,begins.  The cultivation of a hobby and new forms of interest is therefore a policy of first importance to a public man. But this is not a business that can be undertaken in a day or swiftly  improvise  d   ⑤  by a mere command of the will. The growth of alternative mental interests is a long process. The seeds must be carefully chosen; they must fall on good ground; they must be  sedulously   ⑥  tended, if the vivifying fruits are to be at hand when needed.  To be really happy and really safe, one ought to have at least two or three hobbies, and they must all be real. It is no use starting late in life to say: “I will take an interest in this or that.”Such an attempt only aggravates the strain of mental effort. A man may acquire great knowledge of topics unconnected with his daily work, and yet hardly get any benefit or relief. It is no use doing what you like: you have got to like what you do. Broadly speaking, human beings may be divided into three classes: those who are  toil  ed   ⑦  to death, those who are worried to death, and those who are bored to death. It is no use offering the manual labourer, tired out with a hard week’s sweat and effort, the chance of playing a game of football or baseball on Saturday afternoon.   It is no use inviting the politician or the professional or businessman, who has been working or worrying about serious things for six days, to work or worry about trifling things at the weekend.   As for the unfortunate people who can command everything they want, who can gratify every caprice and lay their hands on almost every object of desire ― for them a new pleasure, a new excitement is only an additional satiation.  In vain they rush frantically round from place to place, trying to escape from avenging boredom by mere  clatter  and motion. For them discipline in one form or another is the most hopeful path.  It may also be said that rational, industrious, useful human beings are divided into two classes: first, those whose work is work and whose pleasure is pleasure; and secondly, those whose work and pleasure are one. Of these the former are the majority. They have their compensations. The long hours in the office or the factory bring with them as their reward, not only the means of  sustenance   ⑧  , but a keen appetite for pleasure even in its simplest and most modest forms. But Fortune’s favored children belong to the second class. Their life is a natural harmony. For them the working hours are never long enough. Each day is a holiday, and ordinary holidays when they come are  grudge  d   ⑨  as enforced interruptions in an absorbing vocation. Yet to both classes the need of an alternative outlook, of a change of atmosphere, of a diversion of effort, is essential.   Indeed, it may well be that those whose work is their pleasure are those who most need the means of   banish   ing   ⑩   it at intervals from their minds.",1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

147,"The Law of the Garbage Truck      Sixteen years ago I learned an important life lesson, in the back of a New York City taxi cab.  I hopped   ①  in a taxi, and we took off for Grand Central Station. We were driving in the right lane when, all of a sudden, a black car jumped out of a parking space right in front of us.  My taxi driver slammed   ②  on his brakes, skidded   ③  , and missed the other car by mere inches! The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, whipped his head around and started yelling bad words at us. My taxi driver just smiled and waved at the guy. And I mean, he was actually friendly!  So, I asked him, ""Why did you just do that? This guy almost ruined your car and could've sent us to the hospital!"" And this is when my taxi driver told me about what I now call, ""The Law of Garbage Trucks.""  ""Many people are like Garbage Trucks.   They run around full of garbage, full of frustration, full of anger, and full of disappointment.   As their garbage piles up, they need a place to dump    ④   it, and if you let them, they'll dump it on you.   When someone wants to dump on you, don't take it personally. Instead, just smile, wave, wish them well, and move on.  You'll be happier because you did.""  Wow. That really got me thinking about how often do I let Garbage Trucks run right over me?  AND, how often do I then take their garbage and spread it onto other people: at work, at home, on the streets? It was that day I resolved, ""I'm not going to do it anymore.""  Since then, I have started to see Garbage Trucks everywhere. Just as the kid in the Sixth Sense movie said, ""I see dead people,"" I can now say, ""I see Garbage Trucks."" :)  I see the load they're carrying ... I see them coming to drop it off. And like my Taxi Driver, I don't make it a personal thing; I just smile, wave, wish them well, and I move on.",1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0
77,"Make a Better Life for Yourself       Talking about traveling or new jobs, many people often think of “change of environment, change of mood”.  But is it really helpful?  I remember reading a sentence before:  Life sucks   ①  no matter where you are. So don't be fooled by location changes.   This seems a very passive    ②   statement, but it does make sense.  Changing jobs is like traveling. The meaning often does not lie in seeing new landscapes   ③  , but rather in examining yourself with new eyes.  In the end, what you probably find is that these places are not all that different.

Steve was a big boy,looking more like a teenager than a twelve year old,yet,Steve went unnoticed...until Miss White.  Miss White was a smiling,young,beautiful red  hair  ,and Steve was in love!  For the first time in his young life,he couldn’t take his eyes off his teacher;yet,still he failed.He never did his homework,and he was always in trouble with Miss White.  His heart would break under her sharp words,and when he was punished for failing to turn in his homework,he felt just miserable   ③  !Still,he did not study.  In the middle of the first semester of school,the entire seventh grade was tested for basic skills.  Steve hurried through his tests,and continued to dream of other things,as the day wore on.  His heart was not in school,but in the woods,where he often escaped alone,trying to shut out the sights,sounds and smells of his alcoholic home.  No one checked on him to see if he was safe.No one knew he was gone,because no one was sober   ④  enough to care.Oddly   ⑤  ,Steve never missed a day of school.  One day,Miss White’s impatient voice broke into his daydreams.  “Steve!!”Startled   ⑥  ,he turned to look at her.  “Pay attention!”   Steve locked his gaze on Miss White with adolescent adoration    ⑦   ,as she began to go over the test results for the seventh grade.  “You all did pretty well,”she told the class,“except for one boy,and it breaks my heart to tell you this,but...”She hesitated,pinning   ⑧  Steve to his seat with a sharp stare,her eyes searching his face.  “...The smartest boy in the seventh grade is failing my class!”  She just stared at Steve,as the class spun around for a good look.Steve dropped his eyes and carefully examined his fingertips.  After that,it was war!!Steve still wouldn’t do his homework.Even as the punishments became more severe,he remained stubborn   ⑨  .  “Just try it!ONE WEEK!”He was unmoved.  “You’re smart enough!You’ll see a change!”Nothing fazed him.  “Give yourself a chance!Don’t give up on your life!”Nothing.  “Steve!Please!I care about you!”  Wow!Suddenly,Steve got it!!Someone cared about him?Someone,totally unattainable and perfect,CARED ABOUT HIM??!!  Steve went home from school,thoughtful,that afternoon.Walking into the house,he took one look around.  Both parents were passed out,in various stages of undress,and the stench   ⑩  was overpowering!He,quickly,gathered up his camping gear,a jar of peanut butter,a loaf of bread,a bottle of water,and this time...his schoolbooks.Grim faced and determined,he headed for the woods.  The following Monday he arrived at school on time,and he waited for Miss White to enter the classroom.  She walked in,all sparkle and smiles!God,she was beautiful!He yearned for her smile to turn on him.It did not.  Miss White,immediately,gave a quiz on the weekend homework.  Steve hurried through the test,and was the first to hand in his paper.With a look of surprise,Miss White took his paper.  Obviously puzzled,she began to look it over.Steve walked back to his desk,his heart pounding within his chest.  As he sat down,he couldn’t resist another look at the lovely woman.  Miss White’s face was in total shock!She glanced up at Steve,then down,then up.Suddenly,her face broke into a radiant smile.  The smartest boy in the seventh grade had just passed his first test!  From that moment nothing was the same for Steve.Life at home remained the same,but life still changed.  He discovered that not only could he learn,but he was good at it!He discovered that he could understand and retain knowledge,and that he could translate the things he learned into his own life.  Steve began to excel!And he continued this course throughout his school life.  After high-school Steve enlisted in the Navy,and he had a successful military career.   During that time,he met the love of his life,he raised a family,and he graduated from college Magna Cum Laude.During his Naval career,he inspired many young people,who without him,might not have believed in themselves.  Steve began a second career after the Navy,and he continues to inspire others,as an adjunct professor in a nearby college  Miss White left a great legacy.She saved one boy who has changed many lives.I know,because I am the love of his life.

It's   incredibly   ②  hard.   There was the woman walking down the street blowing cigarette smoke in her kid's face;   the guy at the beach wearing his bright yellow banana hammock;   and the woman at the grocery store with 30 items in the 15-items-or-less line.  My challenge of going a whole day without judging actually turned into an exercise that said less about the people around me and more about myself;  it caused me to start examining myself.   I wonder if sometimes we fear the way others respond to us because the way they treat us is a mirror of the way we ourselves behave.  Maybe that's why we notice certain   attributes   ③  in others,  and maybe that's why those attributes can get under our skin.  Perhaps it's because deep down we   identify   ④  with these behaviors that   rub   ⑤  us the wrong way.  During my day of no judgment,  I tried hard to focus my thoughts inward,  so as not to be tempted to judge.  And while I was taking a good hard look at myself,  I realized that my fear of being judged came from my own tendency to judge.  ""Look at her shoes;  I can't believe she wore that dress;  check out that guy's hair.""  Maybe it's just human nature to do this,  but once I became conscious of the habit,  I realized how often I do it,  which brought up the million-dollar question:  ""Who am I to judge?""  No one,  that's who!  After a day of working hard not to judge anyone,  I was   exhausted   ⑥  .  I was grateful to get home where I didn't have to   interact   ⑦  with anyone.  But the day of examining myself had left me   reeling   ⑧  .  If you've never examined yourself,  go ahead and do it!   If you're afraid to do it   (because you're afraid of what you'll find out)   that's even more of a reason to go ahead with the exercise.  Examining yourself can help you build a healthy self-awareness.  So go ahead--check yourself out!You never know what you might find.",1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0

212,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being      If eternal   ①  return is the heaviest of burdens, then our lives can stand out against it in all their splendid lightness. But, is heaviness truly deplorable   ②  and lightness splendid? The heaviest of burdens crushes us. We sink beneath it. It pins us to the ground. The heaviest of burdens is, therefore, simultaneously   ③  an image of life's most intense fulfillment.   The heavier the burden, the closer our lives come to the earth; the more real and truthful they become.  Conversely, the absolute absence of a burden causes man to be lighter than air, to soar into the heights. Take leave of the earth and his earthly being and become only half real. His movements as free as they are insignificant. What then shall we choose; weight or lightness?  I have been thinking about Tomas for many years. But only in the light of these reflections did I see him clearly. I saw him standing at the window of his flat and looking across the courtyard at the opposite walls not knowing what to do.  He had first met Tereza about three weeks earlier in a small Czech town. They had spent scarcely   ④  an hour together. She had accompanied him to the station and waited with him until he boarded the train. Ten days later she paid him a visit. They made love the day she arrived. That night she came down with a fever and stayed a whole week in his flat with the flu. He had come to feel an inexplicable   ⑤  love for this all but complete stranger. She seemed a child to him, a child someone had put in a bulrush   ⑥  basket docked with pitch and sent downstream for Tomas to fetch under the riverbank of his bed.  He knelt down next to her. Her feverous breath quickened and she gave out a weak moan. He pressed his face to hers and whispered calming words into her sleep. And all at once he fancied she had been with him for many years and was dying. He had a sudden clear feeling that he would not survive her death. He would lie down beside her and want to die with her. He pressed his face into the pillow beside her head and kept it there for a long time.  Now he was standing at the window trying to call that moment to account. What could it have been if not love declaring itself to him? But was it love? The feeling of wanting to die beside her was clearly exaggerated   ⑦  ; he had seen her only once before in his life. Was it simply the hysteria   ⑧  of a man who aware deep down of his inaptitude for love, felt the self-deluding need to simulate it? His unconscious was so cowardly   ⑨  that the best partner he could choose for his life comedy was this miserable provincial waitress with practically no chance at all to enter his life.  He remained annoyed with himself until he realized that not knowing what he really wanted was actually quite natural. We can never know what to want because, living only one life,   we can neither compare it with our previous lives nor perfect it in our lives to come.  There is no means of testing which decision is better because there is no basis for comparison. We live even-thing as it comes. Without warming, like an actor going on cold. And what can life be worth if the first rehearsal   ⑩  for life is life itself?  “Einmal ist keinmal.” says Tomas to himself.

That's why I want to make this video and tell you my story.  I remember having a negative body image for as long as I've had memories.  When I was around three years old,  I clearly recall my father picking up another little girl and saying that he couldn't pick me up anymore because I was too heavy.  I learned what a  calorie  was at age five.  I grew up watching my mother diet and exercise   obsessively   ①  ,  which led me to stop eating breakfast and start only drinking weight loss   shakes   ②  at age nine.  When I was about 10 years old,I started to feel self-conscious about my weight.   By 11,   I was restricting my eating    severely   ③   ,   although I didn't really know what I was doing.  I didn't yet know that I was developing an eating disorder.  I made the connection between eating less and losing weight around the time I turned 13.  And by my freshman year of high school,  I'd started exercising,  counting calories,   purging   ④  ,  and restricting to the point of   hospitalization   ⑤  .  Now I'm 17,  and I've spent the last three years of my life in and out of hospitals and recovery centers,  because  I've kept convincing everyone else around me that I was well enough to be home,  even when I was really just learning more tricks to avoid getting caught.  I lied to the people I loved most,and became someone completely unrecognizable.  I   sacrificed   ⑥  my strongest  morals  to protect something that was only hurting me and taking everything from me.  In doing so,  I've missed out on so much of my own life.  I don't know who I am without my eating disorder.  The one thing I know is what keeps me fighting.  I want to be here.I wanna be able to accept the help,  support and love that surrounds me every single day.  I am   motivated   ⑦  to finally make the changes I know I need to make to discover who I really am.  When people ask me what I want to be when I grow up,  I tell them that I want to be happy.  My goal is to make this year,  the year I turn my life around.  I want to look back on this year and feel proud of myself.  My name is Harriet,  and I have hope.   I hope that people who don't know what it's like to have an eating disorder will have    compassion   ⑧   for those who are struggling.   I hope that people who do have eating disorders will feel like they have a voice,   and that they will feel less guilty,   alone,   and hopeless.  If my story   resonates   ⑨  with even one single person,  I will feel like my entire journey has been worthwhile.  Having an eating disorder may not be a choice,  but you can choose to beat this.

304,"The colorful honey      Blue and green honey may look cool, but beekeepers in northeastern France are not happy about their strange-looking new product.   Over the past few months, beekeepers in Ribeauvillé, a town located in the Alsace region, have noticed that bees there have been making honey in many strange colors.  Bees have been returning to apiaries   ①  with different colors coating their bodies. The colors then end up polluting the honey.  A recent research showed that a nearby M&amp;M’s factory is behind the change in color. Waste from the factory has been exposing the bees to a number of chemicals   ②  . Some of the chemicals are used in the outer shells of the candies, which come in many bright colors.  The local beekeepers do not know if the polluted honey is dangerous to eat, but they are not taking any chances. They are throwing away the candy-colored honey, which means a big loss to local businesses.  “For me, it’s not honey,” Alain Frieh, leader of the town’s beekeepers union, tells the Reuters news agency. “It’s not sellable.”  The honey industry in this part of France has been suffering this year.   According to Frieh, many bees died last winter or were unable to make honey because of the bad weather.  This new problem of colored honey is hurting the beekeepers’ way of life even more.  The region   ③  is home to about 2,400 beekeepers and 35,000 colonies of bees, according to Alsace’s chamber   ④  of agriculture. The beekeepers harvest approximately 1,000 tons of honey each year, making the product a big part of the region’s economy.  Agrivalor is the company that processes the M&amp;M's factory's waste.

3,"Develop Your Own Helping Rituals      If you want your life to stand for peace and kindness, it’s helpful to do kind, peaceful things. One of my favorite ways to do this is by developing my own helping rituals   ①  .   These little acts of kindness are opportunities to be of service and reminders of how good it feels to be kind and helpful.  We live in a rural area of the San Francisco Bay Area. Most of what we see is beauty and nature.   One of the exceptions to the beauty is the litter that some people throw out of their windows as they are driving on the rural roads.  One of the few drawbacks   ②  to living out the boondocks   ③  is that public services, such as litter collection, are less available than they are closer to the city.  A helping ritual that I practice regularly with my two children is picking up litter in our surrounding area.   We’ve become so accustomed   ④   to doing this that my daughters will often say to me in animated   ⑤   voices, “There’s some litter, Daddy, stop the car!”  And if we have time, we will often pull over and pick it up. It may seem strange, but we actually enjoy it. We pick up litter in parks, on sidewalks, practically anywhere. Once I even saw a complete stranger picking up litter close to where we live. He smiled at me and said, “I saw you doing it, and it seemed like a good idea.”  Picking up litter is only one of an endless supply of possible helping rituals. You might like holding a door open for people, visiting lonely elderly people in nursing homes, or shoveling   ⑥  snow off someone else’s driveway. Think of something that seems effortless yet helpful. It’s fun, personally rewarding, and sets a good example. Everyone wins.",1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0

In today's world where air pollution is a serious problem, the bicycle is a perfect way of reducing air pollution. Cycling to work is a healthier choice than driving or taking public transport   ②  .   0   f course, it depends on low far you live from your place of work.

205,"Gain the most important in adversity      Everybody has to face bad days in their life.  Some face   ailments   ①  ,  some face fears,  some face poverty,  some face helplessness  etc  etc.  No one can escape from it.  It is a rule of life.   Two things always combine together like joy and sadness,   laugh and cry,   health and illness,   profit and loss,   morning and night,   confidence and    inferiority complex   ②   ,   victory and failure likewise good days and bad days.  You know what is the biggest advantage of bad days?  You come to know GOD.  What is God?  What he can do?  He is so friendly,  understanding,  loving and moreover God is the Superman he can do anything in a second.  Yes true he can do anything.  He is the only light in darkness.   God is so    merciful   ③   he always forgives and never    complain    s   ④   whether you ignore him many times that is why according to me God is the only best and faithful friend who never cheats.  When bad days come a person first of all cannot understand what is going on,  why me?  But after sometimes he realizes his strength and start  s  doing every single thing to come out of it.   And he comes out though that journey is very painful,   when you once crossed it you will find your journey very meaningful,   and   you will feel like as your rebirth.  You have totally changed your thoughts,  your   perception   ⑤  ,  and you can understand life better.  You get the meaning of your life.  In short you start becoming wise.  The biggest lesson of life during bad days according to me is that a person becomes sp  iritual  and a giver which he wasn't before.  Life means to creat  e  it.  First think what you want in your life then start giving the same think.  This is one of the most important thing I have learnt in my life.  You want love then start  spreading  it,  you want money then start giving to   needy   ⑥  ,  you want happiness then start doing all things which give happiness.  Everything is in your hand you only need to give first.  If  you  don't have everything then give or share what you have.  Still you feel you have nothing to share then give  a  smile.  You can't imagine that your smile can do wonder for someone.  So start smiling from today onwards.  The most beautiful lesson I have learnt in my life is that  i  f you are in pain then remember one thing:  time is though hard but it would be the best time of your life.  You know why we have to face hard days?  Did you think about it?  No!!!!  O  K  I will tell you.  We always forget two unforgettable things.  First is God and second is family.  Nowadays money is everything.  Money is important,  in fact very important but it is not a life so why to spend whole life in earning money.  When will we live?  What you can do now you can't do it tomorrow so don't let the day pass without enjoying.   One thing I must share with you is that if you want to grow and learn more than you know,   then do whatever you want to do but beyond your    comfort zone   ⑦   .  Always try to think that I can,  then nothing is impossible for you.  Difficulty is in the mind not in work.  You know one thing when we accept life as it comes or we accept that everything happens for a reason or for our   betterment   ⑧  .  Believe me you will find your hard days as an   adventure   ⑨  but you need to trust God and at the end you will find yourself a winner.  I hope you like it.

"What started out as an extra one-day-a-week benefit    ④   for workers has really become an everyday thing    ，    "said business adviser Maisly Jones.  Why have so many companies started allowing their workers to wear casual clothes   ？   One   r   eason is that it's easier for a company to attract new workers if it has a casual dress code.  “"A lot of young people don't want to dress up for work   ，   "says the owner of a software company   ，   “so it  shard to hire people if you have a conservative   ⑤  dress code   ⑥  ."

In a study made by LeviStrauss and Company   ，   85 percent of employers said that casual dress has a side effect on work.Supporters of casual office wear also say that a casual dress code helps them save money."Suits are expensive   ，   if you have to wear one every day   ，   "one person said.“For the same amount   ⑨  of money   ，   you can buy a lot more casual clothes.,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
42,"To Be or Not to Be      Outside the Bible , these six words are the most famous in all the literature of the world. They were spoken by Hamlet when he was thinking aloud , and they are the most famous words in Shakespeare because Hamlet was speaking not only for himself but also for every thinking man and woman.   To be or not to be , to live or not to live , to live richly and abundantly and eagerly , or to live dully and meanly and scarcely.  A philosopher once wanted to know whether he was alive or not , which is a good question for everyone to put to himself occasionally. He answered it by saying: ""I think , therefore am.""  But the best definition of existence ever saw did another philosopher who said: ""To be is to be in relations.""   If this true , then the more relations a living thing has , the more it is alive.  To live abundantly means simply to increase the range and intensity of our relations. Unfortunately we are so constituted that we get to love our routine. But apart from our regular occupation how much are we alive? If you are interested only in your regular occupation , you are alive only to that extent. So far as other things are concerned--poetry and prose   ①  , music , pictures , sports , unselfish friendships , politics , international affairs--you are dead.   Contrariwise    ②   , it is true that every time you acquire a new interest--even more , a new accomplishment--you increase your power of life.  No one who is deeply interested in a large variety of subjects can remain unhappy; the real pessimist is the person who has lost interest.  Bacon said that a man dies as often as he loses a friend. But we gain new life by contacts , new friends.   What is supremely true of living objects is only less true of ideas , which are also alive.  Where your thoughts are , there will your live be also. If your thoughts are confined only to your business , only to your physical welfare , only to the narrow circle of the town in which you live , then you live in a narrow cir-conscribed life.   But if you are interested in what is going on in China , then you are living in China― if you’re interested in the characters of a good novel , then you are living with those highly interesting people ,  if you listen intently to fine music , you are away from your immediate surroundings and living in a world of passion and imagination.  To be or not to be--to live intensely and richly , merely to exist , that depends on ourselves. Let widen and intensify   ③  our relations.

161,"Potato, egg, or coffee?       Once upon a time a daughter complained to her father that her life was miserable and that she didn’t know how she was going to make it.  She was tired of fighting and struggling all the time. It seemed just as one problem was solved, another one soon followed.  Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Once the three pots began to boil, he placed potatoes in one pot, eggs in the second pot, and ground coffee beans in the third pot.  He then let them sit and boil, without saying a word to his daughter. The daughter,   moaned   ①  and impatiently waited, wondering what he was doing.  After twenty minutes he turned off the burners. He took the potatoes out of the pot and placed them in a bowl. He pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl.  He then   ladled   ②  the coffee out and placed it in a cup. Turning to her he asked. “Daughter, what do you see?”  “Potatoes, eggs, and coffee,” she   hastily   ③  replied.  “Look closer,” he said, “and touch the potatoes.” She did and noted that they were soft. He then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled egg. Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee. Its rich   aroma   ④  brought a smile to her face.  “Father, what does this mean?” she asked.   He then explained that the potatoes, the eggs and coffee beans had each faced the same    adversity    ⑤   C the boiling water.  However, each one reacted differently.   The potato went in strong, hard, and    unrelenting    ⑥   , but in boiling water, it became soft and weak.  The egg was fragile, with the thin outer shell protecting its liquid interior until it was put in the boiling water. Then the inside of the egg became hard.  However, the ground coffee beans were unique. After they were exposed to the boiling water, they changed the water and created something new.  “Which are you,” he asked his daughter. “  When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a potato, an egg, or a coffee bean? ”   Moral: In life, things happen around us, things happen to us, but the only thing that truly matters is what happens within us.

10,"My View on Life Value       We all come to the world, but why do some of us make great achievements known forever and why are they remembered forever even though they leave the world?  And why do some leave the world without anything valuable to his generation and the people?Every one of us will hope to have a significant and valuable life. But what kind of life is both significant and valuable?Answers to the questions are……“If you cherish your value of your own life   ，   you will create something valuable for the world.”  Johann Goth said.“The life value should be judged from his contribution rather than his profession.”  Einstein said. Lei Feng, a communist soldier, said, “one lives to make others a more beautiful life.”As we all know, Marx is an outstanding and great man. He founded his brilliant and scientific theory of  communism   ①  . The theory guides the ways for the human being’s liberation. Marx said, “If we can  elect   ②  one suitable profession, we won’t be  demoralize  d   ③  with its pressure   ，   because we make sacrifice for human beings. Only by this way will we not be addicted to the joy of narrow-minded and individualism. Our happiness belongs to thousands upon thousands of people. I see, although it may be unknown, our cause will never be forgot forever. Even when we depart to God, the kind people will tear down upon our ashes.”When he said these words, he was only 17 years old. He meant his word with his deeds in his late lifetime period. After his death, on his 100-birthday anniversary, the  proletarian   ④  and the revolutionary people of the whole world still cherish the memory of Marx and mourn him respectively. It is his distinguishingable contribution to the mankind that his life is that significant. It is his great devotion to the human being that his life value is beyond measure. We also know that Lu Xun is a man of great. Without his nobility “Fierce-browed, I wooly  defy   ⑤  a thousand point fingers, head bowed like a willing ox I serve the children”, and without his spirit of his loyalty and devotion to the last for the bright future of the Chinese people, his life would not have been so significant and so great.   Actually, didn’t those regarded as essence of human who live forever in the hearts of people make great contributions to the cause of the people?  Wouldn’t the people remember those whose great achievements for human are recorded in history? We know for certain that not every of us will be a second Marx or Lu Xun. However, a person of noble aspirations will do solid work. Struggle continuously and effortless. He will try to make his greatest contribution in his shortest time. He will try what he can to bring benefit to the people in his lifetime. We’d say it is impossible for one to live alone if he isolates society and people. If he hopes to make a benefit life, he will bring benefit and make contribution to people. As a socialist youth, he will devote his life to the cause of communism in order to make a benefit life.   Moreover, we say that a value of life will be only in direct proportion to achievement and contribution he makes to our society.  In our real life, we can see many revolutionary martyrs die young for the people. Don’t you think they cherish the life? Yes. They do. They are sentimentally attached to life; they are full of hope and desire. But they  confront   ⑥  the death bravely and resolutely in order to make many more people live. Their brilliant status will be living in the hearts of people. They die glorious and great. The life of those who die busy about his lifetime without any achievements can not be compared with their life. In our real life, we have many cases like those. Life is endless and tackling key problems will be continuous. Let’s take these as examples. Mr. Jing Zhuying worked for the Chinese science causes to the last of his life. Mr. Zhang Hua sacrificed his own young life for the sake of others, which set a good example of the communist. Mr. An Ke died for fulfillment for the duty as a citizen. Ms Zhang Haiti, compared to be Paul of our time, worked very hard and faced frustrations of her life, though she was disabled. She still continues to live on bravely. All these are the strong of their life. Their value of life is precious. My fellow students, don’t you say what a beautiful life they have? Beethoven once said: “I must learn to control my life which will never make me give myself up. Oh, If only I can live more than thousands times!”Paul Cocking also had a golden saying, “Life is but one.”I think every youth of us keep this in our minds. Let’s turn it into reality with our deeds. Let’s not be a man full of promises but without any deeds, like Lusting, one of the characters by Dougeshefol. My fellow students, let’s not wander. Let’s not hesitate. Only  lament   ⑦  and  vexation   ⑧  does not mean consideration and exploration. Only lament and vexation does not mean advancing and does not mean mature at all. Let’s not kill our lifetime by playing cards. Let’s not waste our youth by drinking. Let’s not destroy our will without any achievements. Let’s make great contribution to human. And only by these can we create benefit life. Every one will have to die and every body will be rotten. But every one may make achievements and contributions. We hate being rotten.

186,"The Choice of Companion       A good companion is better than a fortune, for a fortune cannot purchase those elements of character which make companionship a blessing.  The best companion is one who is wiser and better than ourselves, for we are inspired by his wisdom and virtue to nobler   deeds  .  “Keep good company and you shall be one of the number.” said George Herbert. “A man is known by the companion he keeps.” Character makes character in the associations of life faster than anything else.   Purity    begets   purity, like begets like; and this fact makes the choice of companion in early life more important even than that of teachers and    guardians   .  It is true that we cannot always choose all of our companions, some are   thrust  upon us by business or the social relations of life, we do not choose them, we do not enjoy them; and yet, we have to associate with them more or less.   The experience is not altogether without    compensation   , if there be   principle   enough in us to bear the    strain   .  Still, in the main, choice of companions can be made, and must be made. It is not best or necessary for a young person to associate with “Tom, Dick, and Harry” without   forethought  or purpose. Some fixed rules about the company he or she keeps must be observed. The subject should be uttermost in the thoughts, and   canvassed  often.  Companionship is education, good or not; it develops manhood or womanhood, high or low; it lifts soul upward or drags it downward; it ministers to virtue or vice.
